What ways have I tried to get the PCI adapter pass and I FAILED !

#2 VMware Workstation Pro + Tools + Home Assistant OS on Windows 10 pro
#3 Windows Server 2019 + Home Assistant OS on Server VM
#4 Oracle VirtualBox + Extension Pack + Home Assistant OS on Windows Server 2019
#5 VMware Workstation Pro + Tools + Home Assistant OS on Windows Server 2019

ALL FAILED!!!
